### Adding an Expense
```

what did you spend it on? food
when? (YYYY-MM-DD) or just press enter for today: 2024-03-20
```

### Setting Budget Limits
```
what category do you want to set a budget for? food
what's your budget for food? â‚¹200

## Data Storage

The application uses two JSON files for data persistence:

- `expenses.json` - Stores all your expense entries
- `budget.json` - Stores your category-wise budget limits

**Note**: These files are automatically created when you first use the application.

## Data Model

Each expense is stored as a JSON object:
```json
{
  "amount": 25.50,
  "category": "food",
  "date": "2024-03-20"
}
```
